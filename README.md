# ToDoLy

This is a "to do list" project via Terminal. The application will allow a user to create
new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong
to. They will need to use a text based user interface via the command-line.Once they are using the application,
the user should be able to also edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit
and save the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former
state restored. 

## Main features:
‣ Model a task with a task title, due date, status and project
‣ Display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by date and project
‣ Support the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks
‣ Support a text-based user interface
‣ Load and save task list to file
